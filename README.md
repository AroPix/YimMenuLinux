# YimMenu start script
A script to make it easy to download and inject Yim into either Steam or Wine Prefixes

# About wine_injector.exe
This injector is a compiled version of https://github.com/crwn1337/wine_injector
If you don't trust my executable, compile it yourself (You will need cmake, gcc and mingw-w64-gcc)

For the sake of making it easier, i precompiled it :D
